# Fetch-Backend-Challenge-Node

This repository contains the backend code for the Fetch Backend Challenge implemented in Node.js.

## Using Docker
### Note:The below commands are for Linux/macOS environment 
### Set Up
1. Install Docker by following the instructions in the official Docker documentation: [https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).

2. Clone repository
```
git clone https://github.com/parthjain99/Parth-Jain-Fetch-Backend-Challenge-Node.git
```

### Starting the server
1. Navigate to the directory where the Dockerfile is located.
    ```
    cd Parth-jain-Fetch-Backend-Challenge-Node
    ```

2. Build the Docker image by running the following command:
    ```
    docker build . -t node-fetch-backend
    ```

4. Run the Docker container with the following command:
    ```
    docker run -p 5001:5001 -d node-fetch-backend
    ```

5. The server should now be running and accessible on port 5001. You can access it using the following URL:
    ```
    http://localhost:5001/recipts
    ```

### Testing
1. Install frisby
    ```
    npm install frisby
    ```
2. Run unit tests with the following command:
    ```
    npm run test
    ```

3. To test the "POST" request for a receipt, you can use cURL with the following command:
    ```
    curl -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
            -d '{
        "retailer": "Walgreens",
        "purchaseDate": "2022-01-02",
        "purchaseTime": "08:13",
        "total": "2.65",
        "items": [
            {"shortDescription": "Pepsi - 12-oz", "price": "1.25"},
            {"shortDescription": "Dasani", "price": "1.40"}
        ]
    }' \
          -X POST \
          http://localhost:5001/receipts/process
    ```

4. To get points for a specific ID, use the following cURL command:
    ```
    curl  http://localhost:5001/receipts/[id]/points
    ```

### Stop the server
1. Get the container ID by running the following command:
    ```
    docker ps
    ```

2. Kill the Docker container using the container ID with the following command:
    ```
    docker kill [container-id]
    ```
### What Each Script does.

1. controller/pointController.js:
   - This script contains two controller functions: `processReceipts` and `getPoints`.
   - `processReceipts` handles the processing of a receipt, validates its fields, calculates the receipt points based on certain criteria, and stores the points in a data dictionary.
   - `getPoints` retrieves the points associated with a receipt ID from the data dictionary.

2. controller/processReceipt.js:
   - This script contains several helper functions that are used to calculate different aspects of the receipt points.
   - Each function performs a specific calculation based on certain conditions or criteria defined in the requirements.
   - The `countTotalAmount` function utilizes these helper functions to calculate the total receipt points based on the provided retailer, purchase date, purchase time, items, and total.

3. controller/validateReceipt.js:
   - This script contains validation functions to check the validity of different fields in the receipt.
   - The functions validate the retailer name, total amount, item descriptions, purchase date, and purchase time.
   - The `validateall` function combines these individual validations and returns a validation result and an error message.

4. receiptRoute.js:
   - This script defines the routes for processing a receipt and retrieving the receipt points.
   - It uses the `processReceipts` and `getPoints` functions from the pointController.js script as route handlers.

5. server.js:
   - This script sets up an Express server and listens on a specified port.
   - It imports the receiptRoute.js script to handle the /receipts route.
   - It uses the express.json middleware for parsing incoming JSON requests.
   - It includes a basic error handling middleware.

6. APIUnitTest.js
    -This script contains unit tests for testing the functionality and behavior of the API endpoints using the Frisby library.It performs 20 tests.
